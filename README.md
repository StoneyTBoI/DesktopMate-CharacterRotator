# Desktop Mate Character Rotator

**Desktop Mate Character Rotator** is a simple Unity mod that lets you control the character's rotation in Desktop Mate.

## Features
- **Character Rotation**: Spin the character around different axes using your own keybinds.
- **Customizable Controls**: Change the rotation keys to whatever works best for you.
- **Toggle Rotation**: Turn rotation on or off with a quick key toggle.
- **Debugging Mode**: Check out some rotation logs if you want to see what's going on behind the scenes.
- **Works with Custom Characters**: Whether it's an official one or a custom mod (VRM 0.0 and 1.0 both work!), from my testing—if it loads, it rotates!

## Installation

1. First, grab [MelonLoader](https://melonwiki.xyz/) and install it for Desktop Mate.
2. Download the latest release of **Desktop Mate Character Rotator**.
3. Drop the `.dll` file into the `Mods` folder in your MelonLoader directory.
4. Launch the game, and you'll be good to go!

## Note
Just a heads up, I'm not a professional developer, so the code might be a bit rough around the edges. If you spot any bugs or issues, feel free to fix them and I'll happily merge your changes!

## Usage

### Default Keybinds:
- **Rotate Left (Roll Positive)**: Left Arrow Key
- **Rotate Right (Roll Negative)**: Right Arrow Key
- **Rotate Up (Pitch Positive)**: Up Arrow Key
- **Rotate Down (Pitch Negative)**: Down Arrow Key

- **Rotate Yaw Down (Yaw Negative)**: Page Down Key

### Adjusting Keybinds:
Want to change the keys? No problem! Just go into `.\UserData\MelonPreferences` to set up your preferred rotation keys, the Keycodes can be found [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/KeyCode.html).

## TODO
Here's a list of features I’m planning for future updates:

- [ ] **GUI for Custom Keybinds**: A simple interface to change keys without editing preferences manually.

- [ ] **Rotation Speed Control**: Add an option to adjust how fast or slow the rotation happens.

## Currently Working Features
- [x] **Basic Character Rotation** (Roll, Pitch, Yaw)
- [x] **Customizable Keybinds**
- [x] **Rotation Toggle**
- [x] **Debug Mode Logging**
